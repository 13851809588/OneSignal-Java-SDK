<!--
  - Checkstyle suppressions configuration.
  -
  - You should think long and hard about putting suppressions in here.
  - If Checkstyle is telling you there's something wrong, then there
  - is probably something wrong. Don't override checks here just to
  - work around a Checkstyle warning that you really should fix.
  -
  - If you absolutely must put a suppression in here, then you MUST
  - include a brief comment explaining why the suppression is necessary.
  -
  - Any suppression added without a reasonable reason will be
  - summarily deleted and the person that added it will be publicly flogged.
